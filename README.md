ChinaAidsWalk
=============
Background Info:

/**The first AIDS Walk was organized in Los Angeles in 1985 to raise awareness about HIV/AIDS, to reduce stigma & discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS, and to raise money for social projects related to HIV/AIDS. 

The China AIDS Walk takes the initiative to Mainland China. We hereby encourage you to step up and take part in helping out those affected by HIV/AIDS and spreading awareness & understanding about HIV/AIDS throughout the country!

You are warmly invited to participate in an epic one-day hiking event on the Great Wall, which will be preceded by an all-out fundraising drive. The funds raised will benefit people living with HIV/AIDS with medical needs & anti-discrimination initiatives all over China.All throughout the fundraising drive and the hiking event, we will guide participants in reaching out to their family, friends and colleagues with accurate information about HIV/AIDS and the supported projects. We trust that your energetic contributions will result in a snowballing awareness campaign which will benefit ever-increasing numbers of Chinese (and foreign) people.

China AIDS Walk is an annual event, which will take its participants all over the Great Wall of China. We start in 2012 in Beijing, hoping to make our way across the country during the coming years and to gain support along the way.We’re looking forward to having you as a walking companion and can’t wait to start our journey together.**/

Now we are inviting the PHP geek volunteers to help us working on the online project.

ChinaAidsWalk Needs Your Help!

Cheers.
